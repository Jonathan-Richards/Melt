/*
* Melt: a program for semi-randomly progressively pixelsorting
* 
* Author: Jonathan Richards, jonrds@gmail.com
*
* This is a Processing program for taking an image and turning it
* into a gif by progressively pixelsorting it. The code has been
* made available due to requests, but has not been fully documented.
* Use at your own risk.
* 
* No command line usage is available, the program must be partially
* rewritten for each image so READ THE MODE DESCRIPTIONS and pick
* a combination you like.
*
* An example showcasing the differences between the modes (often
* subtle) can be found here:
